# ML_Project3_KNN_Iris
This project focuses on applying the KNN algorithm on the Iris dataset. It includes 2 models:
* One created from scratch, without using the in-built function
* One that used the in-built function

The implementation includes the following (for each model in part):
* Euclidean and Manhattan distances;
* different k values: 1, 3, 5, 7;
* visualisation of the results
* evaluation metrics:
    * accuracy
    * precision
    * recall
 
Finally, the 2 models are compared in terms of accuracy and speed.
